## Rationale

The idea is to see how many days us as a community can solve!

I felt like the default Advent of Code leaderboard puts too much emphasis on individual competition, which I found unpleasant (it activates my ego too much ha).

## Notes

Integrated into the [Virtual Coffee](https://virtualcoffee.io) slack workspace ☕️
